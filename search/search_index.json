And there is no exception for butt plugs. While many butt plugs claim \"smartness\", just connecting it to the internet typically only means a remote control with more range. However SmartAss Plug has some more tricks up its sleeves. It's main purpose is not to vibrate a butt, but to sense and gauge sexual arousal. Having a reliable way to measure sexual arousal and orgasms opens up many possibility for the kinky minded person. Pneumatic anal probes have long time being the preferred choice in the clinical sector. However, in the kinky maker space the inflatable butt plug has gained more traction. Not least because of open source projects like the nogasm and the protogasm. However, the inflatable butt plug suffers from a really bad signal to noise ratio. SmartAss Plug tries to build on these groundwork adding a more reliable sensor element, a more robust clench detection algorithm utilizing a kalman filter and calculus. All in a self-contained unit doing away with trip wires. In order to control a pleasure inducing device it connects to XToys or buttplug.io / infitface.</p> <p>Naturally it vibrates, too (kind of a minimum requirement, obviously) and comes with more fun like a 9-DoF IMU and RGB Leds.

However, using this comes with some notable downsides. For some the size of these plugs can be daunting. Also the inflated portion - which is the actual sensor - sits behind the anal sphincter most of the time. As the signal we are looking for is the involuntarily clenching of the pelvic floor, the signal to noise ratio of an inflatable butt plug is not that great. It does pick up a lot of noise like breathing or even the heart beat. These signals can falsely trigger the algorithm leading to unsatisfying results. The coiled silicone tube sits exactly where the clenches happen resulting in a much cleaner signal to start with.</p>"},{"location":"#where-can-i-buy-this","title":"Where can I buy this?","text":"<p>So far you can't buy it.

The installation is a little bit fiddly, but with the right tricks not that hard.</p> <p>Start by making a single knot 5-6 cm away from the tube end. Pull the knot really tight. It will seal the one end of the tube. Use the tweezers to push the short end into the hole where the tube will later exit to form the coil. Inside that hole there is a special cavity for the knot.

Be especially cautious.</p> <p>Then try to grab the end of the tube from the other side (this hole will be hidden later) and pull it through. Gently pull it until the knot is at the hole. Then try to pull the knot inside the cavity. This requires some force and most likely it will snap right through and exit on the other side. Don't panic. Pull it gently back into the cavity, while holding the short end under tension. With this trick the knot will stay safely inside the plug.</p> <p></p> <p>Finally wrap the tube around the shaft of the plug. Apply a slight tension so that the winding is tight and compact.

Push the 2 mm x 45 mm spring into the tube. It should stick out 3-5 mm when completely pushed in. If you've cut the tube too short, you can massage a few millimeters out of the coil. It is important, that the inner spring has some compression. Push the 4 mm x 10 mm outer spring over the tube, so that it sits flush with the bottom.</p> <p>Then press the tube and springs over the port of the pressure sensor.
